# AirBnB MongoDB Analysis

A little assignment to practice importing and analyzing data within a MongoDB database.


## Part 1

### Data Set Report: Airbnb Listings in Vienna

#### Origin of the Data Set

The data set originates from **Inside Airbnb**, a website providing Airbnb data for cities around the world. The specific dataset for Vienna can be found at [Inside Airbnb's Vienna page](https://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/). This dataset offers detailed information on Airbnb listings in Vienna, including descriptions, locations, prices, and reviews.

#### Data Format

The original data file is in **CSV (Comma-Separated Values)** format. CSV files are simple text files where each line represents a data record, and each field within a record is separated by a comma.

#### Raw Data Sample

Below is a sample of the first 20 rows from the dataset, showing a selection of fields to give an idea of the data structure. Note that some text in fields has been clipped to prevent line-wrapping, and not all columns are displayed due to space constraints.

I love this city and I love meeting guests from different parts of the world :-) During my travel, both privately and on duty, I have learned the importance of safe, clean and comfortable accommodation in a central location with good infrastructure. This is what I offer you with my apartments.   Most of my apartments are located in the same building right on the underground U4 Meidling Hauptstrase that connects to the city center in less than 10min, and at the same time walking distance to Palace Schönbrunn - Austria´s biggest tourist attraction.   My city centre apartment is located next to Hofburg Palace with walking distance to all the inner city attractions.  As the majority of my apartments are located in the same building it is very convenient for groups as well to stay with me.

I love this city and I love meeting guests from different parts of the world :-) During my travel, both privately and on duty, I have learned the importance of safe, clean and comfortable accommodation in a central location with good infrastructure. This is what I offer you with my apartments.   Most of my apartments are located in the same building right on the underground U4 Meidling Hauptstrase that connects to the city center in less than 10min, and at the same time walking distance to Palace Schönbrunn - Austria´s biggest tourist attraction.   My city centre apartment is located next to Hofburg Palace with walking distance to all the inner city attractions.  As the majority of my apartments are located in the same building it is very convenient for groups as well to stay with me.

This is what I offer you with my apartments.   Most of my apartments are located in the same building right on the underground U4 Meidling Hauptstrase that connects to the city center in less than 10min, and at the same time walking distance to Palace Schönbrunn - Austria´s biggest tourist attraction.   My city centre apartment is located next to Hofburg Palace with walking distance to all the inner city attractions.  As the majority of my apartments are located in the same building it is very convenient for groups as well to stay with me.

As such, I regularly visit art exhibitons, and love to go on short trips to historical cities and cultural sites of Europe's past.  Since a few years however, much of my spare time is dedicated to my passion of Tango argentino, and whenever time allows I travel around visiting festivals and marathons, dancing days and nights in a row... Apart from that, I am interested in literature, film, theatre and music with a broad taste ranging from indie pop to classical music, from hip hop to world and crossover.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |within an hour    |100%              |92%                 |t                |https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/808772/profile_pic/1310468360/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small                            |https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/808772/profile_pic/1310468360/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium                            |Wieden              |1                  |1                        |['email', 'phone']              |t                   |t                     |Vienna, Austria      |Wieden                |                            |48.19527|16.36374 |Private room in rental unit|Private room   |2           |         |1 shared bath   |        |1   |[]       |$46.00 |2             |30            |1                     |2                     |30                    |30                    |2.0                   |30.0                  |                |t               |12             |42             |69             |332             |2023-12-15           |405              |22                   |3                     |2011-08-11  |2023-12-09 |4.74                |4.79                  |4.69                     |4.79                 |4.74                       |4.9                   |4.75               |       |f               |1                             |0                                          |1                                           |0                                          |2.69             |

Ich liebe Fotografieren, Filme, Bücher und Musik. Und außerdem liebe ich Reisen! Während meiner vielen traumhaft schönen, zum Teil auch abenteuerlichen Trips durch die Welt traf ich auf so viele wunderbare Gastgeber, welche mir durch ihre Gastfreundschaft zusätzliche bleibende Eindrücke hinterließen. Durch diese schönen Erfahrungen wuchs in mir der Wunsch, eine Art „Zuhause auf Zeit“ für andere zu gründen, eines, indem sich kreative Menschen und Familien, Wochenendreisende und Traveller, Fremde und Freunde an einem Ort begegnen.

I love this city and I love meeting guests from different parts of the world :-) During my travel, both privately and on duty, I have learned the importance of safe, clean and comfortable accommodation in a central location with good infrastructure. This is what I offer you with my apartments.   Most of my apartments are located in the same building right on the underground U4 Meidling Hauptstrase that connects to the city center in less than 10min, and at the same time walking distance to Palace Schönbrunn - Austria´s biggest tourist attraction.   My city centre apartment is located next to Hofburg Palace with walking distance to all the inner city attractions.  As the majority of my apartments are located in the same building it is very convenient for groups as well to stay with me. My offer spans from studio apartments of 30m2 to 3 bedroom apartments of 100m2 sleeping up to 14 persons.  Since 1 January 2015 I have been an Airbnb Super Host.

#### Data Problems and Scrubbing Tasks

Upon initial review, the dataset appears to be well-structured; however, common issues in such datasets that might require attention include:

1. **Missing Values**: Fields like `reviews_per_month` might contain null values, especially for listings without any reviews. So we filled missing review scores with the average score.
```python
average_score = data['review_scores_rating'].mean()
data['review_scores_rating'] = data['review_scores_rating'].fillna(average_score)
```

2. **Inconsistent Data**: The `name` field might contain various formats, making it challenging to extract structured information. So we standarized the name and neighbourhood by capitalizing it.
```python
data['name'] = data['name'].str.title()
data['neighbourhood'] = data['neighbourhood'].str.title()
```
3. **Incorrect encoding** The `neighbourhood_cleansed` field does not handle german umlauts correctly, they are encoded improperly so they have to be fixed. So we encoded them properly.
```python
replacements = {
    'Rudolfsheim-Fnfhaus': 'Rudolfsheim-Fünfhaus',
    'Landstra§e': 'Landstraße',
    'Dbling': 'Döbling',
    'Whring': 'Währing'
}

for original, replacement in replacements.items():
    data['neighbourhood_cleansed'] = data['neighbourhood_cleansed'].str.replace(original, replacement)
```

4. **Outliers**: Prices or minimum nights might have unrealistic values due to data entry errors or unique listings. So we removed extreme values.
We did this by using this code 
```python
# Remove dollar signs and commas, then convert to float
data['price'] = data['price'].str.replace('$', '').str.replace(',', '').astype(float)

# Perform the filtering
data = data[(data['price'] > 0) & (data['price'] <= 10000)]

# When adding the dollar sign back, consider formatting the float to two decimal places
data['price'] = '$' + data['price'].round(2).astype(str)
```
